# APALACHE project

A symbolic model checker for TLA+

__master__: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/konnov/apalache.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/konnov/apalache)

__unstable__: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/konnov/apalache.svg?branch=unstable)](https://travis-ci.org/konnov/apalache)

Apalache translates TLA+ in the logic supported by the SMT solvers, for instance, [Microsoft Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3). Apalache can check inductive invariants (for fixed or bounded parameters) and check safety of bounded executions (bounded model checking). To see the list of supported
TLA+ constructs, check the [supported features](docs/features.md). In general,
Apalache runs under the same assumptions as TLC.

## Releases

Check the [releases page](https://github.com/konnov/apalache/releases).

We recommend you to run the latest docker image `apalache/mc:latest` and
checkout the source code from
[master](https://github.com/konnov/apalache/tree/master), which accumulate
bugfixes over the latest release, see the [manual](docs/manual.md#useDocker).
To try the latest cool features, check the [unstable
branch](https://github.com/konnov/apalache/tree/unstable).

## Getting started

Read the [user manual](docs/manual.md).

## Performance

We are collecting [apalache benchmarks](https://github.com/konnov/apalache-tests).
See the Apalache performance when
[checking inductive invariants](https://github.com/konnov/apalache-tests/blob/master/results/001indinv-report.md)
and running
[bounded model checking](https://github.com/konnov/apalache-tests/blob/master/results/002bmc-report.md). Version 0.6.0 is a major improvement over version 0.5.2
(the version [reported at OOPSLA19](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3360549)).
