(**
 * ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ We have to call this module Functions in any
 * case, otherwise, SANY complains.
 *
 * This file contains alternative definitions for the operators defined in
 * Functions. Most importantly, we are adding type annotations. We also
 * define the Apalache-compatible behavior.
 *
 * These definitions are automatically rewired by the Apalache importer.
 *
 * Compare with the original definitions in Functions.tla:

(**
 * Range of a function.

(**
 * The inverse of a function.

 *                                 (0 :> "a" @@ 1 :> "b" @@ 2 :> "c")
 * Example:

 *    IN Inverse(f, DOMAIN f, {1,3}) =
 *                                 1 :> "b" @@ 3 :> "a")

(**
 * A function is injective iff it maps each element in its domain to a
 * distinct element.

(**
 * This operator is not defined in the community modules.
 * As a temporary workaround, we define it globally.
 * TODO: It should be declared as LOCAL, once this issue is fixed:

 * element in the domain that maps to it.

(**
 * Applies the binary function op on all elements of DOMAIN fun in arbitrary
 * order starting with op(f[k], base). The resulting function is:
 *    op(f[i],op(f[j], ..., op(f[k],base) ...))
 *
 * op must be associative and commutative, because we can not assume a
 * particular ordering of i, j, and k
 *
 * Example:
 *  FoldFunction(LAMBDA x,y: {x} \cup y, {}, <<1,2,1>>) = {1,2}
 *
 * @type: ((b, c) => c, c, a -> b) => c;

 * in arbitrary * order starting with op(f[k], base). The resulting

 *
 * op must be associative and commutative, because we can not assume a
 * particular ordering of i, j, and k
