(*
 * This is an internal module that is used to resolve circular dependencies

(**
 * A copy of Apalache!FoldSet, which should be used only in Apalache rewirings.
 *
 * The folding operator, used to implement computation over a set.
 * Apalache implements a more efficient encoding than the one below.
 * (from the community modules).
 *
 * @type: ((a, b) => a, a, Set(b)) => a;

__ApalacheFoldSet(Op(_, _), v, S) ==
    \* A dummy implementation. Apalache rewires it with ApalacheOper.foldSet.
    v

(**
 * A copy of Apalache!FoldSeq, which should be used only in Apalache rewirings.
 *
 * The folding operator, used to implement computation over a sequence.
 * Apalache implements a more efficient encoding than the one below.
 * (from the community modules).

 * @type: ((a, b) => a, a, Seq(b)) => a;

__ApalacheFoldSeq(Op(_, _), v, seq) ==
    \* A dummy implementation. Apalache rewires it with ApalacheOper.foldSeq.
    v

(**
 * A sequence constructor that avoids using a function constructor.  This
 * operator creates the sequence `<<F(1), F(2), ..., F(N)>>` for a constant
 * expression `N`.  This operator is more efficient than the indirect
 * application of `FunAsSeq([ i \in 1..N |-> F(i) ])`.
 *
 * @type: (Int, (Int -> a)) => Seq(a);
 *)
__ApalacheMkSeq(N, F(_)) ==
  \* A dummy implementation. Apalache rewires it with ApalacheOper.mkSeq.
