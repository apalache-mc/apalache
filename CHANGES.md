### Features

- Server port is now configurable via the `--port` CLI argument or `server.port` configuration key (see #2264).

## 0.30.0 - 2022-10-31

### Breaking changes

- The format of parsing error outputs has been changed. Parsing error messages that used to be prefixed with `Error by TLA+ parser` are now prefixed with `Parsing error` and error messages that used to begin with `Syntax error in annotation:` will now also include the `Parsing error` prefix. This is being recorded as a breaking change since it could break scripts that rely on parsing stdout. (See #2204 and #2242.)

### Features

- Check invariants at step 0 with --discard-disabled=false, see #2158 and #2161

## 0.29.0 - 2022-09-06

### Breaking changes

- Invalid configuration keys found in configuration sources (e.g., `apalache.cfg` files) will now produce a configuration error on load (see #2125).
- The structure of the apalache.cfg has changed. All configuration keys that were previously supported have been moved under the `common` key. You can update your config files by prefixing each key from the previous versions with `commong.key-name`. For an example config file, see https://apalache.informal.systems/docs/apalache/config.html#file-format-and-supported-parameters. See #2065.
- Introduce --features=no-rows for the old record syntax and switch to `--features=rows` by default

### Features

- All CLI parameters can now be configured via `apalache.cfg` files. See #2065 and documentation to follow.
- From now on, the type checker reports an error, when the inferred type is more specific than the annotated type, see #2109.

   due to an optimization

## 0.6.0 [RELEASE]

 * Using `z3` version `4.8.7`

 * A 2-8x speedup for 5 out 16
   [benchmarks](https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache-tests),
   due to the optimizations and maybe switching to z3 4.8.x.

 * Distributing the releases with docker as `apalache/mc`

 * The results of intermediate passes are printed in TLA+ files
   in the `x/*` directory: `out-analysis.tla`, `out-config.tla`,
   `out-inline.tla`, `out-opt.tla`, `out-parser.tla`,
   `out-prepro.tla`, `out-priming.tla`, `out-transition.tla`,
   `out-vcgen.tla`

 * The model checker is translating only `KerA+` expressions,
   which are produced by `Keramelizer`

 * Multiple optimizations that were previously done by rewriting
   rules were move to the preprocessing phase, produced by
   `ExprOptimizer`

 * Introducing Skolem constants for `\E x \in S: P`, such
   expressions are decorated with `Skolem`

 * Introducing `Expand` for `SUBSET S` and `[S -> T]`, when
   they must be expanded

 * Translating `e \in a..b` to `a <= e /\ e <= b`, whenever possible

 * Supporting sequence concatenation: `<<1, 2>> \o <<4, 5>>`

 * Short-circuiting and lazy-circuiting of `a /\ b` and `a \/ b`
   are disabled by default (see docs/tuning.md on how to enable them)

 * Introduced `PrettyWriter` to nicely print TLA+ expressions
   with proper indentation

 * The preprocessing steps -- which were scattered across the code
   -- are extracted in the module `tla-pp`,
   which contains: `ConstAndDefRewriter`, `ConstSimplifier`,
   `Desugarer`, `Normalizer`, see [preprocessing](docs/preprocessing.md)

 * Bounded variables are uniquely renamed by `Renaming`
   and `IncrementalRenaming`

 * Massive refactoring of the TLA intermediate representation

 * TLA+ importer stopped chocking on the rare TLA+ syntax, e.g.,
   `ASSUME` and `THEOREM`

 * Backtracking expressions to their source location in a TLA+ spec

 * `LET-IN` is translated into `LetInEx` in `tlair`

 * Nullary LET-IN expressions (without arguments) are processed by
   the model checker directly, no expansion needed

 * The assignment solver has been refactored. The assignments are
   now translated to `BMC!<-`, for instance, `x' <- S`

 * Constant assignments in `ConstInit` are now preprocessed correctly

 * User operators are not translated to `TlaUserOper` anymore,
   but are called with `TlaOper.apply`

 * Importing `tla2tools.jar` from Maven Central
