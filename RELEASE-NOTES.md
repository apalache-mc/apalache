## 0.15.0

### Features

* Model checker: receiving the types from with the type checker Snowcat, see #668 and #350
* Model checker and type checker: Snowcat is the only way to compute types now
* Type checker: the old Apalache type annotations are no longer supported, see #668
* Type checker: tagging all expressions with the reconstructed types, see #608
* Type checker: handling TLA+ labels like `lab("a", "b") :: e`, see #653
* Type checker: always treating `<<...>>` in `UNCHANGED <<...>>` as a tuple, see #660
* Type checker: handling the general case of EXCEPT, see #617
* Preprocessing: handling the general case of EXCEPT, see #647

### Changed

* Preprocessing: massive refactoring of the passes to support types. This may have introduced unexpected bugs.
* Model checker: translation rules for records and functions have been modified, in order to support new types. Bugs to
  be expected.
* Intermediate representation: renamed BmcOper to ApalacheOper. Its operators have the prefix `Apalache!` now.

### Removed

* Unused rewriting rules and `FailPredT` in the model checker, see #665
* Intermediate representation: removed non-standard operators subsetProper, supset, supseteq, see #615
* Intermediate representation: removed TlaArithOper.{sum,prod}, as they are not standard, see #580
* Intermediate representation: removed TlaOper.chooseIdiom
