/**
 * For shared-memory communication of information about specification predicates between `Pass`es
 *
 * ==Motivation==
 *
 * When checking a spec, there is a set of predicates which are singled out for special treatment, such the predicate
 * which initializes state variables and the predicate that computes state transitions. We call these "specification
 * predicates".
 *
 * A few specification predicates are determined purely on the basis of configuration input. However, most specification
 * predicates can only be finalized after inspecting the given `TlaModule` through a sequence of several passes. We call
 * specification predicates that cannot be determined based on configuration input alone "derived predicates". We can
 * also view specification predicates which ''can'' be derived directly from configuration input as derived predicates
 * which, however, are derived via a constant function that ignores any additional input from the `TlaModule`.
 *
 * Due to the way we are currently sequencing the execution of passes, the only way to communicate data between passes
 * is either to add it on to the `TlaModule` they process, or share some mutable state. Since we aim to keep the
 * `TlaModule` as trim as possible, we opt for the latter (tho see
 * https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache/issues/2105 for a possible alternative). Since derived predicates must be
 * communicated between passes, we need some mutable state to serve as the communication channel. That is the purpose of
 * the `DerivedPredicates` trait.
 *
 * Since most specification predicates are derived predicates, and in order to reduce sources of possible confusion when
 * reasoning about the communication of specification predicates, the communication of all predicates between passes
 * should be via implementations of `DerivedPredicates`.
 *
 * ==Usage==
 *
 * ===Writable access to derived predicates===
 *
 * Passes that need to update the derived predicates should take a [[DerivedPredicates.Configurable]] parameter.
 *
 * {{{
 * import com.google.inject.Inject
 * import at.forsyte.apalache.tla.lir.TlaModule
 * import at.forsyte.apalache.infra.passes.Pass.PassResult
 *
 * class MyPass @Inject() (derivedPreds: DerivedPredicates.Configurable) {
 *
 *   def execute(module: TlaModule): PassResult = {
 *      // compute specification predicates
 *      derivedPreds.configure(
 *        init = init,
 *        next = next,
 *        //  etc...
 *      )
 *   }
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * Any subsequent passes that receive an injected `DerivedPredicates` will then have access to these predicates names.
 *
 * ===Read only access to derived predicates===
 *
 * Passes that only need to read derived predicates should take a [[DerivedPredicates]] parameter.
