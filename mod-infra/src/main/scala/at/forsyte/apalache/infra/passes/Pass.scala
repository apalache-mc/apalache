/**
 * <p>An analysis or transformation pass. Instead of explicitly setting a pass' input and output, we interconnect passes
 * with Google Guice and delegate the actual calls to the pass. Thus, normally, passes follow a pipeline, but they also
 * can follow an arbitrary graph.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that the passes must be stateless, as no guarantee is provided on that the same pass is called several times.
 * When a pass finishes its job, it should set up the properties of the next pass.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you are looking for a way to store intermediate results, use a KeyValueStore.</p>
