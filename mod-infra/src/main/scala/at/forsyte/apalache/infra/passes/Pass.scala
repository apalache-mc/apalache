/**
  * <p>An analysis or transformation pass. Instead of explicitly setting
  * a pass' input and output, we interconnect passes with Google Guice and
  * delegate the actual calls to the pass. Thus, normally,
  * passes follow a pipeline, but they also can follow an arbitrary graph.</p>
  *
  * <p>Note that the passes must be stateless, as no guarantee is provided
  * on that the same pass is called several times. When a pass finishes
  * its job, it should set up the properties of the next pass.</p>
  *
  * <p>If you are looking for a way to store intermediate results, use a KeyValueStore.</p>
