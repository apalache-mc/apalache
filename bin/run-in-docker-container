# Run apalache as the invoking user doppelganger
# We need to also thread the environment along to the doppelganger
# NOTE:
#  - Invoking sudo with `--preserve-env` works for all envvars **except** the PATH
#  - Unless we explicitly give it `=PATH`
#  - We need to `--set-home`, so it doesn't inherent to home of the root user
#  - Finally, we need to invoke our command with `env` to get the environment propagated
#    to the apalache invocation itself
