# NOTE: We build the docker image for Apalache in two phases:
#
# 1. BUILD IMAGE: We use a robust JDK 8 base image to build the package.
# 2. APP IMAGE: We then use a smaller base image, with a different JDK fur
#    execution, and copy over the executable artifacts from the build image.
#
# We use a different base image for two reasons: first, it allows us to provide
# a docker image with a much smaller memory footprint, since we can drop many
# build dependencies; second, JDK 8 is currently necessary for building, but it
# introduces nondetermistic behavior into the Z3 library -- JDK 9+ doesn't have
# this problem.

# 1. BUILD IMAGE
FROM maven:3.6.3-jdk-8-slim AS builder

ADD . /opt/apalache/
WORKDIR /opt/apalache/

# --batch-mode because we are running non-interactive
# skipTests because we check the test in CI, not when packaing the container
RUN mvn --batch-mode -DskipTests package


# 2. APP IMAGE
FROM openjdk:9-slim

# To prepare the app image, we do the following:
#
# - copy over all the artifacts needed to run
# - prepare the enviroment
# - declare the entrypoint

WORKDIR /opt/apalache/
