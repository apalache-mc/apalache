(* TLA+ encoding of a parameterized model of the broadcast distributed  
   algorithm with Byzantine faults.
  
   This is a one-round version of asynchronous reliable broadcast (Fig. 7) from:
  
   [1] T. K. Srikanth, Sam Toueg. Simulating authenticated broadcasts to derive
   simple fault-tolerant algorithms. Distributed Computing 1987,
   Volume 2, Issue 2, pp 80-94
                                                             
   A short description of the parameterized model is described in: Gmeiner,   
   Annu, et al. "Tutorial on parameterized model checking of fault-tolerant   
   distributed algorithms." International School on Formal Methods for the  
   Design of Computer, Communication and Software Systems. Springer  
   International Publishing, 2014.                   
  
   This specification has a TLAPS proof for property Unforgeability: if process p 
   is correct and does not broadcast a message m, then no correct process ever 
   accepts m. The formula InitNoBcast represents that the transmitter does not 
   broadcast any message. So, our goal is to prove the  formula
        (InitNoBcast /\ [][Next]_vars) => []Unforg                    
  
   We can use TLC to check two properties (for fixed parameters N, T, and F):
    - Correctness: if a correct process broadcasts, then every correct process accepts,
    - Replay: if a correct process accepts, then every correct process accepts.

(* A typical proof for proving a safety property in TLA+ is to show inductive invariance:
      1/ Init => IndInv
      2/ IndInv /\ [Next]_vars => IndInv'
      3/ IndInv => Safety
  
   Therefore, finding an inductive invariant is one of the most important and difficult step
   in writing a full formal proof. Here, Safety is Unforgeability and the corresponding indutive
   invariant is IndInv_Unforg_NoBcast. I started with TypeOK and Safety, and then tried to add  
   new constraints (inductive strengthens) in order to have the inductive invariant. In this 
   example, additional constraints are  relationships between the number of messages, pc, and 
   the number of faulty processes.

(* Before doing an actual proof with TLAPS, we want to check the invariant candidate with TLC
   (for fixed parameters). One can do so by running depth-first search with TLC by setting 
   depth to 2.  
  
   Unfortunately, checking Spec_IIU1 with TLC still takes too several hours even in small cases.
   The main reason is that the order of subformulas in IndInv_Unforg_NoBcast makes TLC consider
   unnecessary values and generate an enormous number of initial states which are unreachable 
   in SpecNoBcast. For example, in order to evaluate the subformula in IndInv_Unforg_NoBcast
          pc \in [ Proc -> {"V0", "V1", "SE", "AC"} ],       
   TLC needs to generate and consider (2^{Card(Proc)})^4 cases. However, most of them are 
   elimitated by the last constraint pc = [ i \in Proc |-> "V0" ].
  
   Therefore, it is better to use the following formula IndInv_Unforg_NoBcast_TLC which is 
   obtained by rearranging the order of subformulas in IndInv_Unforg_NoBcast and eliminating
   duplicant constraints. Notice that in order to check an inductive invariant, we need to 
   consider only executions which have only one transition step. Therefore, in the advanced 
   settings of the TLC model checker, we can set the depth of executions to 2.
