---- MODULE Antipatterns ----
(* Contains a collection of known-to-be-inefficient Apalache constructs, a.k.a. "antipatterns".
We explain why these constructs are inefficient in 
https://apalache.informal.systems/docs/apalache/antipatterns.html

The purpose of this file is to collect known antipatterns, so we can measure just how 
much they affect performance, across various versions of Apalache.
As a side-effect of the work done on ADR20, the performance hit when using anipatterns,
while still present, is expected to be less drastic than before.
