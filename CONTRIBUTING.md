# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Apalache!

Apalache is a symbolic model checker for [TLA+][].

<!-- TODO(shonfeder): Add code of conduct -->

The easiest
way to contribute is to [open a new issue][] to report a bug or a feature
request. If you want to contribute to the code base, [searching for "help
wanted"][help-wanted] is a good place to start. If you would like to begin
working on an existing issue, please indicate so by leaving a comment. If you'd
like to work on something else, open an issue to start the discussion.

The rest of this document outlines the best practices for contributing to
Apalache:

## Decision Making

<!-- TODO(QUESTION): Do we want this much overhead to contributions? -->

When contributing to the project, the following process leads to the best chance
of landing changes:

1. All work on the code base should be motivated by a [Github Issue][]. The
   issue helps capture the problem we're trying to solve and allows for early
   feedback.
2. Once the issue is created, maintainers may request more detailed
   documentation in the form of a [Request for Comment (RFC)][rfc] or
   [Architectural Decision Record (ADR)][adr].
3. Discussion at the RFC stage will build collective understanding of the
   dimensions of the problem and help structure conversations around trade-offs.
4. When the problem is well understood but the solution leads to large
   structural changes to the code base, these changes should be proposed in the
   form of an ADR. The ADR will help build consensus on an overall strategy to
   ensure the code base maintains coherence in the larger context. If you are
   not comfortable with writing an ADR, you can open a less-formal issue and the
   maintainers will help you turn it into an ADR.
5. When the problem and proposed solution are well understood, implementation
   can begin by opening a [pull request](#making-a-pull-request).

## Making a pull request

We develop on the `unstable` branch and release stable code on `master`.

Nontrivial changes should start with a [draft pull request][] against
`unstable`. The draft signals that work is underway. When the work is ready for
feedback, hitting "Ready for Review" will signal to the maintainers that you are
ready for them to take a look.

Where possible, implementation trajectories should aim to proceed as a series of
small, logically distinct, incremental changes, in the form of small PRs that
can be merged quickly. This helps manage the load for reviewers and reduces the
likelihood that PRs will sit open for longer.

Each stage of the process is aimed at creating feedback cycles which align
contributors and maintainers to make sure:

- Contributors don’t waste their time implementing/proposing features which
  won’t land in `main`.
- Maintainers have the necessary context in order to support and review
  contributions.

## Dependencies

For setting up the local build, see the [instructions on building form
source](https://apalache.informal.systems/docs/apalache/installation/source.html).

### Environment

The necessary shell environment is specified in [.envrc](./.envrc). You can:

- use [direnv][] to load the environment automatically
- source this file manually from your shell
- or use it as a reference for what to put in your preferred rc files

[direnv]: https://direnv.net/

## Development Environment

If you use a different development environment or editor set up, please document
it here!

### IntelliJ IDEA

Download the community edition of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
and set up a new project.

### Emacs

You can use the [metals][] Scala language server together with [lsp-mode][] for
a nice IDE experience in the world's best lisp driven operating system.

#### Install `metals-emacs`

##### Arch

Using yay to install from AUR:

```sh
yay -Syu metals
```

#### Doom Emacs

[Doom Emacs][doom-emacs] streamlines configuration and installation:

Edit your [~/.doom.d/init.el](~/.doom.d/init.el), to uncomment `scala` and
configure it use lsp:

```elisp
       (scala              ; java, but good
        +lsp)
```

Run `doom sync` and restart. That's it.

#### Vanilla Emacs

For installation and configuration in vanilla emacs, see
https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/emacs.html

## Testing

### Unit tests

Run the units

```sh
make test
```

### Integration tests

#### Installing Dependencies

We use [mdx](https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx) for CLI integration tests.

Here is a platform agnostic installation recipe:

```sh
# Install opam
sh <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh)
# Install mdx
opam install mdx
```

For alternative installation methods for opam, see https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html

#### Running the tests

To build a fresh executable and run all the integration tests, execute

```sh
make integration
```

For more details on running the integration tests, see [./test/tla/cli-integration-tests.md](./test/tla/cli-integration-tests.md).

### Continuous Integration

We run continuous integration tests using [GitHub actions](https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache/actions).

The CI configuration is located in
[.github/workflows/main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml).

## Changelog

### Structure

[./UNRELEASED.md](./UNRELEASED.md)
: A living record of the changes not yet released.

[./RELEASE-NOTES.md](./RELEASE-NOTES.md)
: A frozen record documenting the changes added since the last release, only
  present in release-commits.

[./CHANGES.md](./CHANGES.md)
: The accumulated history of all the changes, across all versions.

### Recording changes

Every non-trivial PR must update the [unreleased changes log](./UNRELEASED.md).

Changes for a given release should be split between the five sections:

1. Breaking Changes
2. Features
3. Improvements
4. Bug Fixes
5. Documentation

## Releases

### Via GitHub

We have configured our GitHub CI to automate the release process. The workflows
are configured in [./.github/workflows/prepare-release.yml][] and
[./.github/workflows/release.yml][].

The process proceeds in two steps:

1. CI prepares a release, and opens a PR with the version changes and release
   notes. These are triggered every Monday by a cron job or [manually via the
   GitHub UI][github-ui].
2. A human reviews the PR, approves it, and merges into the trunk, at which
   point CI kicks in to:
   - tag the commit
   - package the artifact
   - publish it as a GitHub release
   - announce the release in our internal `#releases` slack channel

[./.github/workflows/prepare-release.yml]: ./.github/workflows/prepare-release.yml 
[./.github/workflows/release.yml]: ./.github/workflows/prepare-release.yml
[github-ui]: https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Prepare+Release%22

### Manually

#### Requirements

- [hub](https://github.com/github/hub) installed
  - With a `GITHUB_TOKEN` variable in your shell environment holding an access
    token with repo permissions (you can use the same token as for
    `release-me`).

#### Prepare the release

Assuming the current version recorded in the project's `pom.xml` files is
`l.m.n-SNAPSHOT`, the manual release process is as follows:

- [ ] `git checkout unstable && git pull`
- [ ] Run `./script/release-prepare.sh` to
  - create and checkout a branch `release/l.m.n`.
  - prepare and add a release commit `[release] l.m.n`
  - update the changelog
  - bump the version number
  - commit the changes
  - opens a pr into `unstable` with the title `[release] l.m.n`.
- [ ] Get the PR reviewed and merged and **DO NOT SQUASH THE CHANGES** on merge.

If you need to set a specific version (e.g., to increment to a major version),
override the `RELEASE_VERSION` when preparing the release:

```sh
RELEASE_VERSION=l.m.n ./script/release-prepare.sh
```

#### Cut the release

When the PR is merged into `unstable`:

- [ ] Checkout the `[release] l.m.n` commit from the latest `unstable`
- [ ] Run `./script/release-publish.sh` to
  - tag the release commit
  - package the
  - create the release on github
- [ ] Update the download links at https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml#L7
