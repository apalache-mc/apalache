# Let there be (few) assignments

## Description

TLA+ does not have special syntax for assignments to the variables.
For a good reason. The power of TLA+ is in writing constraints
on variables rather than in writing imperative steps. That is similar to
functional languages, where side effects are carefully avoided.
