# The standard operators of TLA+

In this document, we summarize the standard TLA+ operators in a form that is
similar to manuals on programming languages. The purpose of this document is to
provide you with a quick reference, whenever you are looking at the [Summary of
TLA]. The [TLA+ Video
Course](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/videos.html) by Leslie Lamport
is an excellent starting point, if you are new to TLA+.  For a comprehensive
description and philosophy of the language, check [Specifying Systems] and the
[TLA+ Home Page]. You can find handy extensions of the standard library in
[Community Modules].

We explain the semantics of the operators under the lenses of the [Apalache
model checker].  Traditionally, the emphasis was put on the temporal operators
and action operators, as they build the foundation of TLA. We focus on the "+"
aspect of the language, which provides you with a language for writing a single
step by a state machine.  This part of the language is absolutely necessary for
writing and reading system specifications.  Moreover, we treat equally the
"core" operators of TLA+ and the "library" operators: This distinction is less
important to the language users than to the tool developers.

In this document, we present the semantics of TLA+, as if it was executed on a
computer that is equipped with an additional device that we call an _oracle_.
Most of the TLA+ operators are understood as deterministic operators, so they
can be executed on your computer. A few operators are non-deterministic, so
they require the oracle to resolve non-determinism, see [Control Flow and
Non-determinism]. This is one of the most important features that makes TLA+
distinct from programming languages.  Wherever possible, we complement the
English semantics with code in [Python](https://www.python.org/). Although our
semantics are more restrictive than the denotational semantics in Chapter 16 of
[Specifying Systems], they are very close to the treatment of TLA+ by the model
checkers: [Apalache](https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache) and
[TLC](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tools.html). Our relation between
TLA+ operators and Python code bears some resemblance to
[SALT](https://github.com/Viasat/salt) and
[PlusPy](https://github.com/tlaplus/PlusPy).

_Here, we are using the ASCII notation of TLA+, as this is what you
type. We give the nice LaTeX notation in the detailed description.  The
translation table between the LaTeX notation and ASCII can be found in [Summary
of TLA]._
