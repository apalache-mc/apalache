# Installation

There are three ways to run Apalache:

  1. [JVM](./jvm.md): download a prebuilt package and run it in the JVM.
  1. [Docker](./docker.md): download and run a Docker image.
  1. [Source](./source.md): build Apalache from sources and run the compiled package.

If you just want to try the tool, we recommend [downloading the
release](./jmv.md) or [pulling the docker image](./docker.md). If you would like
to run the tool on a daily basis or [contribute][] to the project, we recommend
[building the project from the source](./source.md).
