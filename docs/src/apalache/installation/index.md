# Installation

There are three ways to run Apalache:

  1. [Prebuilt package](./jvm.md): download a prebuilt package and run it in the JVM.
  2. [Docker](./docker.md): download and run a Docker image.
  3. [Build from source](./source.md): build Apalache from sources and run the compiled package.

If you just want to try the tool, we recommend using the [prebuilt package](./jvm.md).

## System requirements

**Memory**: Apalache uses Microsoft Z3 as a backend SMT solver, and the required
memory largely depends on Z3. We recommend to allocate at least 4GB of memory
for the tool.
