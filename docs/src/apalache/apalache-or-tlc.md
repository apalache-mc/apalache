# Shall I use Apalache or TLC?

We recommend starting with TLC. It is mature, well-documented, and
well-integrated into TLA+ Toolbox. Once you have debugged your TLA+
specification, and TLC is still producing too many reachable states, switch to
Apalache. We are using this approach at [Informal
Systems](https://informal.systems/).
