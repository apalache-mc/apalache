# Principles of Symbolic Model Checking with Apalache

In order to take advantage of Apalache's symbolic model checking, there are a
few principles one must bear in mind when writing TLA.

Note that Apalache requires type annotations. Check the [Snowcat tutorial](../../tutorials/snowcat-tutorial.md)
and [HOWTO on annotations](../../HOWTOs/howto-write-type-annotations.md).
