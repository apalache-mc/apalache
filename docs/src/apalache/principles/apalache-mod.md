# The Apalache Module

Similar to the `TLC` module, we provide a module called `Apalache`, which can be found in [Apalache.tla][]. Many of
the operators in that module are used internally by Apalache, when rewriting a TLA+ specification. It is useful
to read the comments to the operators defined in [Apalache.tla][], as they will help you in understanding
the [detailed output](./running.md#detailed) produced by the tool.

See the detailed description of the [Apalache operators][].
