This ADR describes an alternative encoding of the [KerA+] fragment of TLA+ into SMT.
Compound data structures, e.g. sets, are currently encoded using the [core theory] of SMT,
with the goal being to encode them using [arrays with extensionality] instead.
The hypothesis is that this will lead to increased solver performance and more compact SMT instances.
We target the [Z3] solver and will use the [SMT-LIB Standard] ([Version 2.6]) in conjunction
with Z3-specific operators, e.g. constant arrays.

For an overview of the current encoding check the [TLA+ Model Checking Made Symbolic] paper,
presented at OOPSLA'19. In the remainder of the document the use of the new encoding and the
treatment of different TLA+ operators are described.

## 1. CLI encoding option

The encoding using arrays is to be an alternative, not a replacement, to the already existing encoding.
Given this, a new option is to be added to the `check` command of the CLI. The default encoding will be
the existing one. The option description is shown below. The envvar `SMT_ENCODING` can also be used to
set the encoding, see the [model checking parameters] for details.

```
--smt-encoding : the SMT encoding: oopsla19, arrays (experimental), default: oopsla19 (overrides envvar SMT_ENCODING)
```

### Code changes

The following changes will be made to implement the new CLI option:

- Add new string variable to class `CheckCmd` to enable the new option.
- Add new `smtEncoding` field to `SolverConfig`.
- Add new class `SymbStateRewriterImplWithArrays`, which extends class `SymbStateRewriterImpl`.
- Use the new option to set the `SolverConfig` encoding field and select between different `SymbStateRewriter`
  implementations in classes `BoundedCheckerPassImpl` and `SymbStateRewriterAuto`.

## 2. Testing the new encoding

The new encoding should provide the same results as the existing one, the available test suite
will thus be used to test the new encoding. To achieve this, the unit tests needs to be made parametric
w.r.t. the `SolverConfig` encoding field and the implementations of `SymbStateRewriter`, and the
integration tests need to be tagged to run with the new encoding.

### Code changes

The following changes will be made to implement the tests for the new encoding:

- Refactor the classes in `tla-bmcmt/src/test` to enable unit testing with different configurations
  of `SolverConfig` and implementations of `SymbStateRewriter`.
- Add unit tests for the new encoding, which should be similar to existing tests, but use a
  different solver configuration and `SymbStateRewriterImplWithArrays` instead of `SymbStateRewriterImpl`.
- Add integration tests for the new encoding by tagging existing tests with `array-encoding`, which
  will be run by the CI with envvar `SMT_ENCODING` set to `arrays`.

## 3. Encoding sets

Sets are currently encoded in an indirect way. Consider a sort `some_sort` and distinct elements `elem1`,
`elem2`, and `elem3` of type `someSort`, as defined below.

```
(declare-sort some_sort 0)
(declare-const elem1 some_sort)
(declare-const elem2 some_sort)
(declare-const elem3 some_sort)

(assert (distinct elem1 elem2 elem3))
```

A set `set1` containing `elem1`, `elem2`, and `elem3` is currently represented by a constant of type 
`set_of_some_Sort` and three membership predicates, as shown below.

```
(declare-sort set_of_some_Sort 0)
(declare-const set1 set_of_some_Sort)

(declare-const elem1_in_set1 Bool)
(declare-const elem2_in_set1 Bool)
(declare-const elem3_in_set1 Bool)

(assert elem1_in_set1)
(assert elem3_in_set1)
(assert elem2_in_set1)
```

The new encoding has each set encoded directly as an array whose domain and range equal the set's sort
and the Boolean sort, respectively. SMT arrays can be thought of as a functions, as this is exactly how
they are [represented internally in Z3]. Set membership of an element `elem` is thus attained by simply
setting the array at index `elem` to `true`.

One important point in the new encoding is the handling of set declarations, since declaring an
empty set requires the setting of all array indexes to false. This can be easily achieved for
finite sets by explicitly setting each index, but falls outside the quantifier-free fragment of
first-order logic in the case of infinite sets, e.g. the set of integers. To handle declarations
of infinite sets we rely on Z3's constant arrays, which map all indexes to a fixed value. Below is
an example using the new encoding.

```
(declare-const set2_0 (Array some_sort Bool))
(declare-const set2_1 (Array some_sort Bool))
(declare-const set2_2 (Array some_sort Bool))
(declare-const set2_3 (Array some_sort Bool))

(assert (= set2_0 ((as const (Array some_sort Bool)) false)))

(assert (= set2_1 (store set2_0 elem1 true)))
(assert (= set2_2 (store set2_1 elem2 true)))
(assert (= set2_3 (store set2_2 elem3 true)))
```

The `store` operator handles array updates and receives the array to be updated, the index, and the new
value, returning the updated array. For array access, the `select` operator can be used, which receives
an array and an index and returns the value at the given index, as shown below.

```
(assert (= (select set2_2 elem1) true)) ; SAT
(assert (= (select set2_2 elem2) true)) ; SAT
(assert (= (select set2_2 elem3) true)) ; UNSAT

(assert (= (select set2_3 elem1) true)) ; SAT
(assert (= (select set2_3 elem2) true)) ; SAT
(assert (= (select set2_3 elem3) true)) ; SAT
```

For consistency, the new encoding uses constant arrays to declare both finite and infinite arrays.

### Code changes

The following changes will be made to implement the new encoding of sets:

- Add alternative rewriting rules for sets when appropriate, by extending the existing rules.
  - All alternative rules will be suffixed with `WithArrays`.
  - The new rules will not rely on `LazyEquality` and will aim to use SMT equality directly.
  - Only the generation of SMT constraints will be modified by the new rules, the other Arena
    elements will remain unchanged.
- In class `SymbStateRewriterImplWithArrays`, add the new rules to `ruleLookupTable` by overriding
  the entries to their older versions.
- Add three new Apalache IR operators in `ApalacheOper`, `Builder`, `ConstSimplifierForSmt`, and 
  `PreproSolverContext`, to represent the array operations.
  - The `selectInSet` IR operator represents the SMT `select`.
  - The `storeInSet` IR operator represents the SMT `store`.
  - The `unchangedSet` IR operator represents an equality between the current and new SSA array
    representations. This is required to constraint the array representation as it evolves. It is
    important to note that this operator assumes that all arrays are initially empty, so an element
    not explicitly added is assumed to not be in the array. To check absence of an element,
    `selectInSet` should be used with negation.
- In class `Z3SolverContext`, add/change appropriate methods to handle SMT constraints over arrays.
  - The main changes will de done in `declareCell` and the new `mkSelect`, `mkStore`, and 
    `mkUnchangedSet` methods, as these methods are directly responsible for creating the SMT 
    constraints representing sets and set membership.
  - With the new IR operators, the "in-relation" concept, which underpins `declareInPredIfNeeded` 
    and `getInPred`, will not be applied to the new encoding. Cases for the new IR operators will 
    be added to `toExpr`, which will default to `TlaSetOper.in` and `TlaSetOper.notin` for the 
    existing encoding.
  - Cases for `FinSetT` and `PowSetT` will be added to `getOrMkCellSort`, as these types are no
    longer represented by uninterpreted constants.
  - `cellCache` will be changed to contain a list of cells, in order to handle the effects of
    `push` and `pop` in the SSA assignment of sets. The following examples illustrates this need.
    ```
    (assert (= set_0 ((as const (Array Int Bool)) false)))
    (assert (= set_1 (store set_0 5 true)))
    (push)
    (assert (= set_2 (store set_1 6 true)))
    (push)
    (assert (= set_3 (store set_2 7 true)))
    (assert (= (select set_3 7) true))
    (pop 2)
    (assert (= (select set_1 7) false)) ; Without the list we would query set_3 here 
    ```
