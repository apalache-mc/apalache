## Problem

Users of Apalache have voiced a need for the following kinds of behavior:

- incremental results (that can be iterated through to exhaustively enumerate all counterexamples)
- interactive selection of checking strategies
- interactive selection of parameter values

The discussion around these needs is summarized and linked in
[#79](https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache/issues/79) .

The proximal use cases motivating this feature are discovered in the needs of or
collaborators working on implementing model based testing (MBT) via the
[Modelator](https://github.com/informalsystems/modelator) project.
[@konnov](https://github.com/konnov) has given the following articulation of the
general concern:

> For MBT we need some way to exhaustively enumerate all counterexamples
> according to some strategy. There could be different strategies that vary in
> terms of implementation complexity or the number of produced counterexamples

The upshot: we can provide value by adding a utility that will allow users to
interactively and incrementally explore the transition systems defined by a
given TLA+ spec.

## Proposal

### Overview

In the current architecture, there is a single mode of operation in which

- the user invokes Apalache with an initial configuration, including an input
  specification,
- the specification and configurations are parsed and pre-processed,
- and then the model checker proper drives the
  [TransitionExecutor](./003adr-trex.md) to effect symbolic
  executions verifying the specified properties for the specified model.

This RFC proposes the addition of a *symbolic transition exploration server*.
The server will allow a client to interact with the various steps of the
verification process. The client is thus empowered  to call upon the parser and
preprocessors at will, and to drive the `TransitionExecutor` interactively, via
a simplified API.

The specific functionality that should be available for interaction is
enumerated in the [Requirements](#requirements).

As per [previous
discussions](https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache/issues/730#issue-855835332),
interactivity will be supported by running a daemon (or "service") that serves
incoming requests. Clients will interact via a simple, well supported protocol,
that provides an online RPC interface.

As a followup, we can create our own front-end clients to interact with this
server. In the near term, we envision a CLI, a web front-end, and editor
integrations. Many aspects of such clients should be trivial, once we can use
the client code generated by the gRPC library . See the [gRPC
Example](#grpc-example) for details.

### Architecture

The interactive mode will take advantage of the `TransitionExecutor`'s
abstraction for writing different model checking strategies, to give the user an
abstracted, interactive interface for dynamically specifying checking
strategies.

I propose the following high-level architecture:

- Use an RPC protocol to allow the client and server mutually transparent
  interaction. (This allows us to abstract away the communication protocol and
  only consider the functional API in what follows.)
- Introduce a new module, `ServerModule`, into the `apa-tool` package. This
  module will abstract over the relevant BMC passes which lead up to, and
  provide input for, the `TransitionExplorer`, described below.
- Introduce a new module, `TransitionExplorer` that enables the interactive
  exploration of the transition system.
- Internally, the `TransitionExplorer` will make use of the `TransitionExecutor`
  and relevant aspects of the `SeqModelChecker` (or slightly altered versions of
  its methods).

*NOTE*: The high-level sketch above assumes the new code organization proposed
in [ADR 7][].

[ADR 7]: https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache/tree/main/docs/src/adr/007adr-restructuring.md

#### API

The following is a rough sketch of the proposed API for the transition explorer.
It aims to present a highly abstracted interface, but in terms of existing data
structures. Naturally, refinements and alterations are to be expected during
implementation.

We refer to symbolic states as `Frames`, which are understood as a set of
constraints, and we put this terminology in the API in order to help users
understand when they should be thinking in terms of constraint sets as opposed
to concrete states. Concrete states can be obtained by the functions suffixed
with `Example`.

In essence, this proposed API is only a thin wrapper around the
[TransitionExecutor
class](https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache/tree/main/tla-bmcmt/src/main/scala/at/forsyte/apalache/tla/bmcmt/trex/TransitionExecutor.scala).
During previous iterations of the proposed API we discussed exposing a
higher-level API, targeted at meeting the requirements more directly.  However,
discussion revealed that the expensive computational costs of SAT solving in
most cases made it infeasible to meet the requirements in this way.  Instead, we
must expose most of the underlying logic of the `TransitionExecutor`, and task
the users with building their own exploration strategies with these primitives.

It is likely that we will be able to provide some higher-level functionality to users
by way of wrapper libraries we implement on top of the proposed API, but that
work should be left to a subsequent iteration.

**NOTE:** This interface is intended as an abstract API, to communicate the
mappings from request to reply. See the [gRPC Example](#grpc-example) for a
sketch of what the actual implementation may look like.

/** A State is a map from variable names to values, and represents a concrete state.  */

 *
 * These correspond to the numbered transitions that the `TransitionExectur` uses

```

#### Constructing the IR

In order to form assertions (represented in the spec as values of `TlaEx`),
users will need a way of constructing the Apalache IR. Similarly, they'll need a
way of deconstructing and inspecting the IR in order to extract useful content
from the transitions.

To meet this need, the gRPC libraries we generate for client code will also
include ASTs in the client language along with generated serialization and
deserialization of JSON represents into and out of the AST. This will enable
users to construct and inspect expressions as needed.

#### Protocol

We have briefly discussed the following options:

- Custom protocol on top of HTTP
- JSON-rpc
- gRPC

I propose use of gRPC for the following reasons:

- It will automate most of the IO and protocol plumbing we'd otherwise have to
  do ourselves.
- It is battle tested by [industry](https://grpc.io/)
- It is already used in Rust projects within Informal Systems. This should make
  it easier to integrate into modelator.
- The [Scala library](https://scalapb.github.io/docs/grpc/) appears to be well
  documented and actively maintained.
- [Official support](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/) is provided in many
  popular languages, and we can expect well-maintained library support in most
  languages.
- The gRPC libraries include both the RPC protocol and plumbing for the
  transport layer, and these are decomposable, in case we end up wanting to use
  different transport (i.e., sockets) or a different protocol for some purpose
  down the line.

For a discussion of some comparison between JSON-rpc and gRPC, see

- https://www.mertech.com/blog/know-your-api-protocols
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58767467/what-the-difference-between-json-rpc-with-http2-vs-grpc

I have asked internally, and engineers on both `tendermint-rs` and `hermes` have
vouched for the ease of use and reliability of gRPC.

Using gRPC can help satisfy [TRANS-EX.1::EXTENSIBLE.1] in the following ways:

- [TRANS-EX.1::EXTENSIBLE.1::CLOUD.1] should be satisfied out of the box, since
  HTTP is the default transport for gRPC.
- [TRANS-EX.1::EXTENSIBLE.1::CLI.1] can be satisfied by implementing a CLI
  client that we can launch via an Apalache subcommand.

##### gRPC Example

Here is as simple example of what it would actually look like to configure gRPC
for the server (adapted from [ScalaPB grpc](https://scalapb.github.io/docs/grpc/)):

We define our messages in a `proto` file:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package com.trans-ex.protos;

service TransExServer {
        rpc LoadModel (LoadRequest) returns (LoadReply) {}
}

message LoadRequest {
  required string spec = 1;
  optional repeated string aux = 2;
}

message LoadReply {
  enum Result {
    OK = 0;
    PARSE_ERROR = 1;
    TYPE_ERROR = 2;
    // etc...
  };
  
  required Result result;
  required Model model;
}
```

The generated Scala will look roughly as follows:

```scala

object TransExGrpc {
  // Abstract class for server
  trait TransEx extends AbstractService {
    def serviceCompanion = TransEx
    def loadModel(request: LoadRequest): Future[LoadReply]
  }

  // Abstract class for block client
  trait TransExBlockingClient {
    def serviceCompanion = TransEx
    def loadModel(request: LoadRequest): LoadReply
  }

  // Abstract classes for asynch client + various other boilerplate
}
```

A sketch of implementing a server using the gRPC interface:

```scala

class TransExImpl extends TransExGrpc.Greeter {
  override def loadModel(req: LoadRequest) = {
    val rootModule = req.model
    val auxModules = req.aux
    
    // run incomming specs through parsing passes
    val model : UninitializedModel = Helper.loadModel(rootModule, auxModules)
    
    val reply = LoadReply(result = Ok, model = model)
    Future.successful(reply)
  }
}
```

A sketch of using the client (e.g., to implement our CLI client):

```scala
// Create a channel
val channel = ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress(host, port).usePlaintext(true).build
// Make a blocking call
val request = LoadRequest(spec = <loaded module as string>)
val blockingStub = TransExGrpc.blockingStub(channel)
val reply: LoadReply = blockingStub.loadModel(request)

reply.result match {
  ParseError => // ...
  Ok =>
    val model: UninitializedModel = reply.model
    // ...
}
```

NOTE: To ensure that we are able to maintain a stable API, we should version the
API from the start.
