# Apalache Documentation

The Apalache documentation is written in markdown files in the [./src](./src)
directory and compiled using [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).

To view the documentation, visit https://apalache.informal.systems/docs/ .

## Building and previewing the documentation

To build the documentation into [../target/docs](../target/docs), run

```sh
mdbook build
```

To start a server that will present a live updated view of the book while you
edit, run

```sh
mdbook serve
```

## Notes on writing the documentation

### The Table of Contents

The [./src/SUMMARY.md](./src/SUMMARY.md) specifies the table of contents shown
in the sidebar of the documentation. Any top-level chapters must be linked from
there.

Each chapter must link a file: internal links to anchors within files do not
work. There is an [open issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/167)
to fix this behavior.

### Referring to `README.md` pages

Within the book, any `README.md` page gets converted to an `index.md` page
during compilation. You can link to `README.md` pages in the `SUMMARY.md`, but
everywhere else you must write the link pointed towards `index.md`.

There is an [open issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/1268) to fix
this behavior.

## Internal documentation

Design notes and memos that are part of the documentation of our design process
or for reference by developers are collected in [./internal](./internal).
