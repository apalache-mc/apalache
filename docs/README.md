# Apalache User Manual

The apalache user manual is written in markdown files and compiled using
[mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).

To build the documentation into [../target/docs](../target/docs), run

``` sh
mdbook build
```

To start a server that will present a live updated view of the book while you
edit, run

``` sh
mdbook serve
```
