/**
 * An oracle provides a means of choosing a single value, out of a finite collection of candidate values. It can
 * generate SMT constraints, which capture the conditions under which the chosen value may/must be equal to the
 * candidate values.
 *
 * For the purposes of describing the oracle's behavior, we can assume that there are `N` distinct possible values,
 * which are indexed with `0,1,2,...,N-1` (though they need not be represented as such in the implementation). We refer
 * to the `i`-th candidate value as `vi`.
