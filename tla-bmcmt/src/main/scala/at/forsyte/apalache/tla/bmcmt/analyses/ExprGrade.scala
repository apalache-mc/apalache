/**
  * Similar to TLA+ level, we define grades, which are useful for caching model checking results:
  * <ol>
  * <li> a constant expression, i.e., referring only to constants and constant expressions like 1+3;</li>
  * <li> a state-level expression that is referring to free state variables, but not to their primed copies; </li
  * <li> a state-level expression that is referring to free state variables and bound variables,
  *     but not to their primed copies; </li
  * <li> an action-level expression that is referring only to constants and state variables,
  *      but not parameters or bound variables, e.g., x + 1 if x is a VARIABLE, but not y + 1,
  *      if y is a variable bound with \E y \in ... There must be at least one primed expression inside
  *      an action-level expression, otherwise; it would be a state-level expression.</li>
  * <li> an action-level expression that refers to bound variables and parameters, </li>
  * <li> another expression of higher grade, e.g., a temporal level expression <>A, and</li>
  * <li> an expression that should never be cached, e.g., a type-annotated expression.</li>
  * </ol>
