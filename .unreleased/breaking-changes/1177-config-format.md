The structure of the apalache.cfg has changed. All configuration keys that were
previously supported have been moved under the `common` key. You can update your
config files by prefixing each key from the previous versions with
`commong.key-name`. For an example config file, see
https://apalache.informal.systems/docs/apalache/config.html#file-format-and-supported-parameters.
See #2065.
