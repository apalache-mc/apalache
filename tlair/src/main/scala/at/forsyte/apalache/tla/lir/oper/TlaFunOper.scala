  /**
    * <p>A constructor of a recursive function, which is defined in TLA+ as: `f[x \in S] == ... f[y] ...`.
    * We introduce a three-argument operator, whose arguments are as follows:</p>
    *
    * <ul>
    * <li>function body of type TlaEx that may refer to the function via recFunRef,</li>
    * <li>NameEx(variableName),</li>
    * <li>variable domain of type TlaEx.</li>
    * </ul>
    *
    * <p>Hence, a declaration of a recursive operator looks like a nullary operator declaration,
    * whose body contains the constructor of a recursive function. The body of a recursive function may
    * refer to the function itself by using the operator recFunRef (see below).
    * Note that the output methods should convert this intermediate representation to the standard TLA+ form.</p>
    *
    * <p>There is a reason for defining a recursive function with two operators, rather than by introducing
    * a special case of `TlaDecl`. In TLA+, the operator bodies (as well as function bodies) may refer only to
    * the names that have been defined before. That is why we keep function definitions intermingled with
    * operator definitions. Moreover, we do not refer to the function name in its body, as otherwise, we would
    * run in two problems: (1) the operator name would clash with the function name, an
    * (2) the renaming transformations would try to rename the function. TLA+ forbids mutually recursive functions,
    * so it is sound to refer to the function with the operator `recFunDef`.</p>
    *
    * <p><b>Example.</b>
    * `Fact[n \in Int] == IF n <= 1 THEN 1 ELSE n * Fact[n - 1]` is translated into:</p>
    *
    * <p>
    * `TlaOperDecl("Fact", List(),
    * OperEx(recFunDef,
    * OperEx(TlaControlOper.ifThenElse,
    * (* n <= 1 *),
    * (* 1 *),
    * OperEx(Tla.ArithOper.mult,
    * NameEx("n"),
    * OperEx(TlaFunOper.app,
    * OperEx(recFunRef),
    * OperEx(TlaArithOper.minus, NameEx(n), ValEx(TlaInt(1)))
    * )
    * )
    * ),
    * NameEx("n"),
    * TlaIntSet
    * )
