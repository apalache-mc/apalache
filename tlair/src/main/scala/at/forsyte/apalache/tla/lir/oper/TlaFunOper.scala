  /**
   * <p>A constructor of a recursive function, which is defined in TLA+ as: `f[x \in S] == ... f[y] ...`.
   * We introduce an operator that have at least 3 arguments, whose meaning is as follows:</p>
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li>function body of type TlaEx that may refer to the function via recFunRef,</li>
   * <li>NameEx(variableName1),</li>
   * <li>variable1 domain of type TlaEx.</li>
   * <li>...</li>
   * <li>NameEx(variableName_k),</li>
   * <li>variable_k domain of type TlaEx.</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Hence, a declaration of a recursive operator looks like a nullary operator declaration,
   * whose body contains the constructor of a recursive function. The body of a recursive function may
   * refer to the function itself by using the operator recFunRef (see below).
   * Note that the output methods should convert this intermediate representation to the standard TLA+ form.</p>
   *
   * <p>There is a reason for defining a recursive function with two operators, rather than by introducing
   * a special case of `TlaDecl`. In TLA+, the operator bodies (as well as function bodies) may refer only to
   * the names that have been defined before. That is why we keep function definitions intermingled with
   * operator definitions. Moreover, we do not refer to the function name in its body, as otherwise, we would
   * run in two problems: (1) the operator name would clash with the function name, an
   * (2) the renaming transformations would try to rename the function. TLA+ forbids mutually recursive functions,
   * so it is sound to refer to the function with the operator `recFunDef`.</p>
   *
   * <p><b>Example.</b>
   * `Fact[n \in Int] == IF n <= 1 THEN 1 ELSE n * Fact[n - 1]` is translated into:</p>
   *
   * <p>
   * `TlaOperDecl("Fact", List(),
   * OperEx(recFunDef,
   * OperEx(TlaControlOper.ifThenElse,
   * (* n <= 1 *),
   * (* 1 *),
   * OperEx(Tla.ArithOper.mult,
   * NameEx("n"),
   * OperEx(TlaFunOper.app,
   * OperEx(recFunRef),
   * OperEx(TlaArithOper.minus, NameEx(n), ValEx(TlaInt(1)))
   * )
   * )
   * ),
   * NameEx("n"),
   * TlaIntSet
   * )

   *
   * <p>Note that all indices i_1, ..., i_k are tuples. Normally,
   * they are singleton tuples. For instance, in the expression `[f EXCEPT ![1] = 2]`, the index is `(tuple 1)`.
